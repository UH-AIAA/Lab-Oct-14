# Lab Plan for today

This lab should be awesome -- today is the first day we're going get work done on the project as a team, which has been a long time coming :) More info below:

## Outline:
### Review
 - Review Flight Code Changes/Philosophy that Nathan/Kurt worked on Monday
 - Review git commands and github usage
 - quick refresher on try catch statements
 - Git commands cheat sheet!!

### New
- new GitHub functionality! website only, no new commands :)
- github issues in particular
- error philosophy!! (this is cool i swear)
- choose an error handling model based off of previous discussion
- start with the queue error
- test flight [BFC](https://github.com/UH-AIAA/backup-flight-code), if we find any runtime errors, handle them now
